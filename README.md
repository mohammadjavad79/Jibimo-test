Hi Jibimo team,

This is my testing task for the back-end developer position in your technical team. In this task, I focused on the back-end side using Laravel and infrastructure with Docker. 
I used Laravel tools for create app and SOLID principles to ensure a better coding style.

To get started, please :

1- clone this repository.
2- install Docker on your system. 
3- Once Docker is installed, you can use the 'make build shell' command to build Docker images and create a shell environment to execute php Artisan commands.

I have also created two seeder classes for the users and banks tables. When creating the tables with migration command, please use the '--seed' option to populate them with data.

Also I put all passwords and data that maybe you needed in .envexample too.

Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,
mohammadjavad mohammadian
